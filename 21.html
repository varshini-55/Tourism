        width="600" height="500">
    <p>One of the only two temples in India that is not operated by the Government
        of India, The Chilkur Balaji Temple, or Visa Balaji Temple is unique in many
        aspects. For starters, the temple has no special provisions for any sort of
        VIPs. Moreover, the temple does not accept any sort of donations from the
        visiting devotees.</p><br>
    <p>One of the oldest temples in Telangana, the temple is surrounded by a rich
        history and some fascinating mythological tales. Thanks to this combination,
        the temple attracts approximately 75,000-100,000 devotees every week.</p><br>
    <p>Interestingly, the temple got its name, Visa Balaji Temple as it came to be
        associated with fulfilling the wish of devotees that aspire to settle in a
        foreign country. Legend says by completing 11 “parikramas” or revolutions
        of the temple, one can wish for their visa application to get approved. Once
        it is done, the devotees (according to the ritual) are required to return to the
        temple and complete 108 “parikramas” as a gesture of gratitude for the
        Gods.</p><br>
    <p>The holy significance of the destination makes it one of the best places to
