    <h1><b>About Boating</b></h1>
    <p>Adventure lovers, you don't have to travel too long to quench your thirst for kayaking. The Kotapally Reservoir
        in Ananthagiri Hills arranges plenty of water activities and you can head out there for your share of a kayak.
        Raft in the lake all you like and explore the surroundings when you're done. Several food stalls are set up
        around the lake and you can indulge in some roasted corn after a strenuous water activity. But you can also
        picnic at the lake by carrying your own snacks and eatables. You can trek to Ananthagiri Hills or sign up for
        more activities and stay at Deccan Trails. Also keep an eye out for parakeets since this is also a great
        location for bird watching.This is also a great activity you can plan with your friends over the weekend if
        you've all stayed in the city the last few months.</p>
    <h1><b>What Could Be Better In Boating</b></h1>
    <p>While one can reach Kotapally and book the activity, it would be more convenient to have an online booking
        option. </p>
