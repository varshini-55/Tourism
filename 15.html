    <p>What's your idea of a perfect getaway? Lush greenery, towering hills,
        and a breathtaking sunrise? Just about 80 KM from Hyderabad is
        Ananthagiri Hills in the Vikarabad district. Tucked away inside a
        dense forest, the temperature drops from the average temperature
        of the city which makes this an ideal road trip location to get away
        from the city. Here is a list of top things to do in Ananthagiri Hills.</p>
    <h1>Visit Anantha Padmanabhaswamy Temple</h1>

        width="700" height="500">
    <p>According to locals, Ananthagiri Hills is one of the oldest inhabited
        places in Telangana and the ruined ancient caves and monuments
        are truly a testament to that. It is also where the Musi river
        originates â€” a tributary of the Krishna River that flows through
        Hyderabad. In for a religious journey? Ananthagiri Hills is home to
        one of the popular temples in Telangana called Sri Anantha
        Padmanabhaswamy Temple. This temple is the abode to Lord
        Vishnu but the interesting part is that this was built by a Nizam king
        around 400 years ago and today, it's a symbol for religious
        harmony. </p>
    <h1>Trek Up</h1>

        width="700" height="500">
    <p>If you enjoy trekking, you'd be happy to know that Ananthagiri Hills
        has two trekking trails. One starts from the temple and the other
        starts half a kilometre away from the temple towards Kerelli. These
        treks are beginner friendly and you will find many packages at the
        tourism desk. Feel free to wear your solid hiking shoes and trek your
        way to glory.</p>
    <h1>Plan Your Stay</h1>

        from budget hotels to luxe resorts. We recommend putting up at
        Deccan Trails. If you are all about scoring stunning views, book
        yourself a stay at The GrassWalk Resort and Hills & Valley Adventure
        Resort in Vikarabad are some other options. </p>
    <h1>Go Kayaking</h1>

        width="700" height="500">
    <p>The Kotapally Reservoir in Vikarabad arranges plenty of water activities
        and you can head out there for your share of a kayak. Raft in the lake all
        you like and explore the surroundings when you're done. Several food stalls
        are set up around the lake and you can indulge in some roasted corn after a
        strenuous water activity. But you can also picnic at the lake by carrying your
        own snacks and eatables.</p>
