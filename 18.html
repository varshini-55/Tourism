        dried up. Because of the humidity and intense heat, trekking and exploring 
        the Ananthagiri Hills during this period would be tiring and boring activity.

        because they disappear and cover themselves in the dense forests. But if you’re 
        planning to stay in and enjoy nature’s glory, you can now fly here.</p>
